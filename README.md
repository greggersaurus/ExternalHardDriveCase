## External Hard Drive Case
The idea for this project was to create a storage solution for external hard
 drives and required cables. The specific external hard drive that this was
 designed to hold was a Western Digital My Passport Ultra.

### Design
This was my first attempt at 3D modeling in Blender. I decided to come up with
 something that was fairly simple, both in terms of scope and geometries. 

The idea was to have the hard drive slide into the main enclosure and be held
 in place by a sliding friction based top to the case. A notch was cut from
 this main enclosure so that when the top of the case was remove, the hard
 drive could easily be pushed out.

A secondary enclosure was built off of the main enclosure to house the USB
 cable. The idea here was to two doors that are secured by a sliding latch,
 which is further secured in place when the top cover is inserted.

### Status
The case prints well, however, since not enough tolerance was left for the 
 parts that need to fit into one another (i.e. the top cover, front doors, and
 front doors latch). I was able to sand down the test printing, but want to
 increase tolerances in the 3D modeling file so that this is not needed in the
 future. 

I am also considering redesigning the cable enclosure system as the two doors
 and latch system is not particularly stable or easy to use.

### Software Requirements
This was modeled in Blender 2.75a.

### 3D Printing
A MakerBot Replicator 2  was used to print the parts for this case. Default
 settings were adequate.
